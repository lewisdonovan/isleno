# Hybrid Permissions System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **System Overview**

Successfully implemented a hybrid permissions system that combines:
- **Fine-grained individual permissions** for regular users
- **Department-level access** for department heads
- **Seamless integration** with existing role-based system

## ✅ **Completed Components**

### 1. **Database Schema Extension** (`20250128000004_add_department_level_permissions.sql`)
- **New Resource Types**: `department_kpis`, `department_invoices`, `department_projects`, `department_users`
- **Department Head Role**: `department_head` with department-level permissions
- **Enhanced Functions**: `can_access_department_resources()`, `is_department_head()`, `get_user_department()`
- **Updated RLS Policies**: Support both individual and department-level access
- **Department Context**: Added `department_id` column to `user_permissions` table

### 2. **Permission Service Updates** (`src/lib/services/permissions.ts`)
- **Extended ResourceType**: Added department-level resource types
- **Department Access Methods**: `canAccessDepartmentResources()` for checking department-level access
- **Enhanced PermissionUtils**: Department-level permission utilities
- **Fallback Logic**: Manual department access checking when RPC functions aren't available
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript types for all new permission types

### 3. **React Hooks** (`src/hooks/usePermissions.ts`)
- **useDepartmentAccess()**: Hook for checking department-level access
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and retry functionality
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with department access API endpoint

### 4. **API Endpoints** (`src/app/api/permissions/department-access/route.ts`)
- **Department Access Check**: POST endpoint for checking department-level permissions
- **Authentication**: Proper user authentication and authorization
- **Validation**: Input validation for department_id, resource_type, and action
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and logging

### 5. **Documentation** (`README-HYBRID-PERMISSIONS-SYSTEM.md`)
- **Complete System Documentation**: Architecture, usage examples, and migration guide
- **API Documentation**: Request/response formats and examples
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and debug commands
- **Security Considerations**: Access control and data protection details

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **Permission Hierarchy**
```
1. Direct User Permission (highest priority)
   ↓
2. Role-Based Permission
   ↓
3. Department-Level Permission (for department heads)
   ↓
4. Individual Permission Fallback (lowest priority)
```

### **Department Head Access Flow**
```
User Request → Is Department Head? → Is Resource in Department? → Has Department Permission? → Grant Access
                    ↓                        ↓                           ↓
                Check Individual Permissions → Has Individual Permission? → Grant/Deny Access
```

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **For Department Heads**
- **Unified Access**: Single role grants access to all department resources
- **Department Scope**: Automatic access to KPIs, invoices, projects, and users in their department
- **Flexible Permissions**: Can still have individual permissions for specific resources
- **Easy Management**: One role assignment covers all department needs

### **For Regular Users**
- **Precise Control**: Fine-grained permissions for specific resources
- **Clear Requirements**: Explicit permission requirements for each action
- **Consistent Experience**: Same permission system across all resources
- **Individual Focus**: Access only to resources they need

### **For Administrators**
- **Hybrid Management**: Choose between individual and department-level access
- **Scalable System**: Grows with organization structure
- **Easy Assignment**: Simple role assignment for department heads
- **Granular Control**: Fine-tuned permissions for regular users

## 📊 **Permission Types**

### **Individual Permissions**
```typescript
// Fine-grained permissions
'kpi.view', 'kpi.create', 'kpi.edit', 'kpi.delete'
'invoice.view', 'invoice.approve', 'invoice.edit'
'project.view', 'project.create', 'project.edit', 'project.delete'
'user.view', 'user.edit', 'user.manage_roles'
```

### **Department-Level Permissions**
```typescript
// Department-wide permissions
'department_kpis.view', 'department_kpis.create', 'department_kpis.edit', 'department_kpis.delete'
'department_invoices.view', 'department_invoices.approve', 'department_invoices.edit'
'department_projects.view', 'department_projects.create', 'department_projects.edit', 'department_projects.delete'
'department_users.view', 'department_users.manage_roles', 'department_users.manage_permissions'
```

## 🔧 **Usage Examples**

### **Department Head Access**
```typescript
// Check if user can access all KPIs in their department
const { hasAccess } = useDepartmentAccess(departmentId, 'kpi', 'view')

// Server-side department access check
const canAccess = await serverPermissionService.canAccessDepartmentResources(
  userId,
  departmentId,
  'kpi',
  'view'
)
```

### **Individual Permission Check**
```typescript
// Check individual permission
const { hasPermission } = usePermission('kpi.view')

// Server-side individual permission check
const hasPermission = await serverPermissionService.userHasPermission(
  userId,
  'kpi.view'
)
```

### **Permission Utilities**
```typescript
// Check if user is department head
const isHead = await PermissionUtils.isDepartmentHead(service, userId)

// Get user's department
const departmentId = await PermissionUtils.getUserDepartment(service, userId)

// Convert to department-level permission
const deptPermission = PermissionUtils.toDepartmentLevelPermission('kpi', 'view')
// Returns: 'department_kpis.view'
```

## 🚀 **Benefits**

### **Operational Benefits**
- **Simplified Management**: Department heads get unified access without individual permission management
- **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer permission assignments needed for department heads
- **Better UX**: Department heads see all department resources in unified views
- **Scalable**: System adapts to organizational growth

### **Technical Benefits**
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript types prevent permission errors
- **Fallback Logic**: System works even if new functions aren't deployed yet
- **Database-Level Security**: RLS policies enforce access at the database level
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All permission checks are logged for audit

### **Security Benefits**
- **Department Isolation**: Department heads can only access their own department
- **Permission Validation**: All access goes through the same validation logic
- **Context Awareness**: Department context is validated for all department-level access
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all permission changes and access attempts

## 📋 **Migration Path**

### **From Old Role-Based System**
1. **Deploy Database Migration**: Run department-level permissions migration
2. **Assign Department Head Roles**: Update existing department heads to use `department_head` role
3. **Update UI Components**: Replace role-based checks with permission-based checks
4. **Test Access**: Verify department heads can access all department resources

### **Example Migration**
```typescript
// Old role-based check
if (userRole === 'team_leader' && userDepartment === targetDepartment) {
  // Grant access
}

// New permission-based check
const hasAccess = await serverPermissionService.canAccessDepartmentResources(
  userId,
  targetDepartment,
  'kpi',
  'view'
)
```

## 🔍 **Testing & Validation**

### **Test Scenarios**
- ✅ Department head can access all KPIs in their department
- ✅ Department head cannot access KPIs in other departments
- ✅ Regular user with individual permission can access specific KPIs
- ✅ Regular user without permission cannot access KPIs
- ✅ Department head can still access individual resources with specific permissions
- ✅ Fallback logic works when RPC functions aren't available

### **Debug Commands**
```sql
-- Check if user is department head
SELECT public.is_department_head('user-id');

-- Get user's department
SELECT public.get_user_department('user-id');

-- Check department access
SELECT public.can_access_department_resources('user-id', 'dept-id', 'kpi', 'view');
```
